                BTS (Hangul: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan), also known as the <strong>Bangtan Boys</strong>, is a seven-member South Korean boy band formed in Seoul in 2013.
                The name became a backronym for Beyond the Scene in July 2017. The group initially formed as teenagers under Big Hit Entertainment and released their debut single album, 2 Cool 4 Skool (2013).

                <p> <q>I don't set out to win awards. I don't think any writer does, but when you receive an award, it's an affirmation: it means that people appreciate what you do. Every award I have received is a confirmation of something I have done, and that motivates me to push a little harder.</q> <br>

            <p>Hello! my name is Mia Huljanah. I am 24 years old and come from Jakarta. <br>
                Previously I was a junior Back-End Programmer in Bandung. I've studied microservices architecture, C#, and .Net Framework in 2020. <br>
                Since then I've become more interested in programming, I believe I can become a Full-Stack Developer in the future. <br>
                Studying the "Belajar Pemrograman Web Dasar" class was one of my first steps towards realizing that dream.<br>
                I like coding as much as my sister likes BTS, as a form of appreciation to her who just finished her exam, <br>
                I tried to make a website with her favorite idol bio.</p>
