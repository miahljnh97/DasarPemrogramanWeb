BTS has stated that from their inception, they were convinced that telling their story was the only way for the younger generation to relate to their music. The lyrics of the album primarily reflected on the misunderstanding and prejudice towards them, criticism of the society that diminishes their dreams, and their anxiety and determination towards their future.

Lyrically, the EP expanded on the theme of dreams and happiness, revealing their frustration under the harsh Korean education system and their determination to confront the struggle of proving themselves. Despite several performances on Korean music shows, the single quickly fell off the charts. That same month, BTS starred in their own variety show, SBS MTV's Rookie King Channel Bangtan, based on a fake broadcast station, <q>Channel Bangtan</q>, through which members parodied variety shows such as VJ Special Forces and MasterChef Korea.
                
                At the end of the year, BTS has recognized with several New Artist of the Year awards, including the 5th Melon Music Awards, 28th Golden Disc Awards, and the 23rd Seoul Music Awards.
